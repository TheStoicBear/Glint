Config.RotationSmoothFactor  = 0.15

-- Max distance and angle for auto-tracking
Config.TrackMaxDistance      = 250.0
Config.TrackAngleThreshold   = math.cos(math.rad(90))

-- Spotlight parameters
Config.FloodInnerRadius      = 40.0
Config.FloodOuterRadius      = 40.0
Config.FloodDistance         = 50.0
Config.FloodIntensity        = 40.0

Config.AlleyInnerRadius      = 30.0
Config.AlleyOuterRadius      = 20.0
Config.AlleyDistance         = 35.0
